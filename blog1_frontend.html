        <!-- <h2><a class="link" href="">What is the Future of Frontend Web Development?</a></h2> -->
        <p>
          We have seen a big change from big desktop computers to small,
          portable mobile devices, especially with the rise of wearables in the
          past few years. So, there’s no reason for the tech industry to think
          that other technologies, like front-end web development tools, will go
          through the same big changes. How will this part of the market be
          made? This issue will be predicted in the article from Designveloper.
          Where Is Frontend Web Development (Fwd) Headed? “Is front-end
          development on its way out?” This question was asked on Quora, a large
          social Q&A site, many years ago. Early in 2021, the same problem was
          also brought up on Reddit. In fact, many people worry that front-end
          web development will be a job that no one wants. But this
          end-of-the-world scenario will never come true. We Are Social and
          Hootsuite’s 2021 Global Overview Report says that browsing the web is
          a very popular thing to do on all kinds of devices. Even things that
          people think can only be done on social media apps are mostly done on
          mobile websites. About two-thirds (1.8 billion) of all unique visitors
          to websites come to Facebook each month.

        <h2>Benefits of Mobile-First Approach</h2>
        <p></p>Using a mobile-first design strategy
        has a number of benefits, such as:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Approach More Customers:</strong> As has
              already been said, most web traffic comes from mobile users. Also, a lot
              of different websites, from social networks to e-commerce to e-learning,
              have mobile-based activities. So, if you want your business to get more
              customers, designing mobile interfaces first is a good idea.</li>
  
              <li><strong>Prioritize
                Content:</strong>  Because mobile screens are small, only the most important
                information will be shown on mobile versions of websites. This lets your
                customers know what your company wants them to know.</li>
              <li><strong>Speed up Load
                Times:</strong> A mobile-first approach focuses on the most important parts of a
                website to give visitors the best experience. This will get rid of
                content and elements that aren’t needed, which will make load times
                faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrate with Mobile Functions:</strong> Many people find it more
                  convenient to use a website that is mobile-enabled because its features
                  work with the main functions of mobile phones. For example, when a
                  customer visits an online shop, she can call the shop assistant by
                  clicking on the phone number posted on the site. The same is true when
                  she looks up the store on a map or pays with an e-wallet.</li>
